### Objectives
- Create, configure, and manage machine learning experiments using MLFlow in Google Colab.  
- Track, log, and analyze model performance metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts.  
- Register, organize, and version boosting models in MLFlowâ€™s Model Registry.  
- Explore fundamental principles of reproducibility, version control, and effective collaboration in machine learning projects.  

This exercise closely aligns with the MLOps framework by covering key aspects such as:  
- Data preparation  
- Model training  
- Evaluation  
- Model versioning  
- Best practices in management and orchestration  

### Requirements

- Each student must have a computer.  
- Students need both a Gmail/Colab account and an Ngrok account for full participation during the practical session.
